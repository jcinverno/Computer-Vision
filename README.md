# Computer-Vision Projects Repository

## Overview:
These are some of the projects I've worked on in the field of image processing and computer vision. 

### Project 1: PlantDoc.
Description: This project served as my final capstone, integrating a deep learning solution into a business model. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), it focuses on accurately classifying plant diseases using images of leaves.

### Project 2: QRCode Reader
Description: This system is designed to detect and decode QR codes from images. It can handle various scenarios, including reading isolated QR codes in black and white, identifying positioning blocks for alignment, and locating QR codes within complex images. Additionally, it includes a compilation of class projects covering transformations like color and geometric manipulations.

### Project 3: Detection of vehicles in the same lane
Description: This project combines lane detection using OpenCL and transform techniques with vehicle detection using the YOLO model. The script allows for determining if a vehicle is within the same lane as well as measuring the distance from the preceding vehicle.

### Advance Topics in Image Processing
Description: A compilation of class projects exploring advanced topics in image processing. Utilizing libraries such as OpenCV and OpenCL, these projects delve into various techniques and algorithms for image analysis and manipulation.
