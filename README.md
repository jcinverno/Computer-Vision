# Computer-Vision
These are some of the projects I've worked on in the field of computer vision. These projects will make use of CNNs, VGGs, ResNets, Inception, SSD, RetinaNet, Neural Style Transfer, and GANs.

<b>PlantDoc.:</b> Final capstone project that allowed for the implementation of a business model for a deep learning solution. This solution, uses CNNs, focuses on classifying plant diseases using an image of a leaf.
