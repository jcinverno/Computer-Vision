# Computer-Vision
These are some of the projects I've worked on in the field of computer vision. These projects make use of CNNs, VGGs, ResNets, Inception, SSD, RetinaNet, Neural Style Transfer, and GANs.

<b>PlantDoc.:</b> Final capstone project that allowed for the implementation of a business model for a deep learning solution. This solution, uses CNNs, focuses on classifying plant diseases using an image of a leaf.

<b>ANN_for_image_classification:</b> Simple ANN for image classification using the MNIST dataset.

<b>CNN_for_Fashion_MNIST:</b> CNN for Fashion MNIST dataset.
